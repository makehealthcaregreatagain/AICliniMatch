     ✓ Urgency: URGENT
     I still need: insurance, location"
```

#### 2. Explainable AI
Every specialist match shows **why** they were matched:
- "5 similar cases treated"
- "In-network for patient insurance"
- "Running active clinical trial"
- "High acceptance rate (94%)"

#### 3. Progressive Suggestions
AI suggests refinements in real-time:
- "Add preferred distance filter"
- "Include telehealth options only"
- "Filter by clinical trial participation"

#### 4. Contextual Insights
AI provides proactive recommendations:
- "Dr. Lee is running a trial for similar cases"
- "Consider dental oncology as secondary referral"
- "All matched specialists accept patient insurance"

#### 5. Visual Progress Tracking
Horizontal progress indicator:
```
[●]━━[○]━━[○]━━[○]
Sent  Accepted  Awaiting  Completed
```

### User Flow Comparison

#### Creating a Referral

**v1: 7 clicks, 5 form fields**
1. Click "Start Searching"
2. Toggle "Advanced Search"
3. Fill condition field
4. Fill location field
5. Select radius
6. Fill institution
7. Click search

**v2: 1 input, conversational**
1. Type natural language description
2. AI extracts everything
3. Click "Find Matching Specialists"

Time saved: **~60%**

- PubMed API
- Document upload (HIPAA-compliant)
- Fax/email automation

### Migration Path

#### To switch from v1 to v2:

1. Install Node.js dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Access at `http://localhost:5173`

#### Both versions can coexist:
